# WLM Layers  
**The Seven Structural Layers of the Wujie Language Model**

WLM is built from **seven independent but interlocking protocol layers**, each responsible for a different dimension of structural intelligence.

This document provides a clear, concise, high‑level description of each layer, its purpose, its inputs/outputs, and how it fits into the WLM structural loop.

---

# 🧱 Layer 1 — Structural Language Protocol (SLP)  
**Input → Dimensional Structure**

SLP converts raw input into structured semantic dimensions.

### Responsibilities
- Parse text, video, behavior into structure  
- Extract entities, relations, frames, constraints  
- Normalize meaning into dimensional form  

### Output
A **structured semantic graph**.

### Why it matters
SLP is the **protocol layer** of WLM.  
Every other layer depends on it.

# 🌍 Layer 2 — World Model Interpreter (LWM → Structure)  
**World Model Output → Interpretable Structure**

Converts world‑model predictions into explicit structure.

### Responsibilities
- Spatial topology  
- Object permanence  
- Physical constraints  
- Causal dynamics  

### Output
A **structured world state**.

### Why it matters
It turns world models from black boxes into **explainable systems**.

# 🤖 Layer 3 — Agent Behavior Structure Layer  
**Structure → Stable, Controllable Behavior**

Generates agent behavior from dimensional structure.

### Responsibilities
- Action graphs  
- Goal structures  
- Constraint propagation  
- Decision flows  

### Output
A **structured behavior graph**.

### Why it matters
Agents become **stable, reproducible, controllable**, and non‑chaotic.

---

# 🧬 Layer 4 — Persona / Character Structure Layer  
**Structure → Identity**

Defines stable, consistent identities for characters, NPCs, and virtual humans.

### Responsibilities
- Traits  
- Values  
- Memory  
- Role constraints  
- Narrative arcs  

### Output
A **structured identity graph**.

### Why it matters
Personas no longer drift, collapse, or contradict themselves.

---

# 📚 Layer 5 — Knowledge Structuring Layer  
**Token Soup → Structured Knowledge**

Transforms unstructured text into structured, reason‑ready knowledge.

### Responsibilities
- Knowledge graphs  
- Causal graphs  
- Definitions  
- Ontologies  
- Hierarchies  

### Output
A **structured knowledge graph**.

### Why it matters
AI stops memorizing and starts **understanding**.

Repo: https://github.com/gavingu2255-ai/WLM-Knowledge-Engine

---

# 🧠 Layer 6 — Metacognition Layer  
**Structure → Reasoning Path → Self‑Monitoring**

Tracks and evaluates the AI’s reasoning process.

### Responsibilities
- Reasoning steps  
- Consistency checks  
- Dimension shifts  
- Contradiction detection  
- Self‑monitoring  

### Output
A **structured reasoning trace**.

### Why it matters
Reasoning becomes **transparent, controllable, and non‑hallucinatory**.

Repo: https://github.com/gavingu2255-ai/WLM-Metacognition-Engine

---

# 🌌 Layer 7 — World Generation Protocol (WGP)  
**Structure → Worlds / Universes / Simulations**

Generates coherent, simulation‑ready worlds.

### Responsibilities
- Spatial topology  
- Timelines  
- Physical rules  
- Causal systems  
- Narrative arcs  
- World graphs  

### Output
A **structured world graph**.

### Why it matters
WLM becomes a **world engine**, not just a reasoning engine.

# 🔄 The Layers as a Unified System

```
SLP → LWM → Agent → Persona → Knowledge → Metacognition → World Generation
```

Each layer:

- consumes structure  
- transforms structure  
- outputs structure  

This creates a **closed structural loop** that defines the WLM universe.

---

# 📌 Summary

The seven layers of WLM form a complete structural protocol stack for:

- understanding  
- reasoning  
- acting  
- knowing  
- monitoring  
- generating  

WLM is the **architecture of a structured AI universe**.
