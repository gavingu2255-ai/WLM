# WLM Roadmap  
**From MVP → Structural Engines → Full Universe Protocol**

WLM is already complete at the **protocol level**:  
all seven layers exist, all are implemented as MVPs, and all are structurally coherent.

The roadmap below describes how WLM evolves from:

- **MVP (structural skeleton)**  
→ **Phase 2 (functional engines)**  
→ **Phase 3 (integrated structural intelligence)**  
→ **Phase 4 (full universe generation)**  

This is the long‑term evolution of the WLM ecosystem.

---

# 🟦 Phase 1 — MVP (Completed)  
**Goal:** Establish the structural protocol stack.

### Deliverables (Done)
- SLP: Structural Language Protocol  
- LWM Interpreter  
- Agent Behavior Structure Layer  
- Persona / Character Structure Layer  
- Knowledge Structuring Layer  
- Metacognition Layer  
- World Generation Protocol (WGP)  
- Root WLM meta‑repo  
- Documentation + architecture  

### Outcome
A complete **seven‑layer structural protocol**, ready for expansion.

---

# 🟩 Phase 2 — Functional Structural Engines  
**Goal:** Turn each MVP into a fully operational engine.**

This is where WLM becomes *usable* for real systems.

### 2.1 SLP Engine
- full structural parser  
- multimodal structure extraction  
- dimensional normalization  

### 2.2 LWM Interpreter
- spatial topology extraction  
- physical constraint inference  
- causal event interpretation  

### 2.3 Agent Behavior Engine
- action graph generation  
- constraint‑driven decision flow  
- stable multi‑agent coordination  

### 2.4 Persona Engine
- identity graphs  
- memory structures  
- role‑based behavior constraints  

### 2.5 Knowledge Engine
- structured knowledge graphs  
- definitional networks  
- causal knowledge propagation  

### 2.6 Metacognition Engine
- reasoning trace generation  
- contradiction detection  
- self‑monitoring loops  

### 2.7 World Generation Engine
- region topology  
- entity population  
- rule systems  
- timeline generation  

### Outcome
Each layer becomes a **real engine**, not just a protocol.

---

# 🟧 Phase 3 — Cross‑Layer Integration  
**Goal:** Make the seven layers operate as a single structural intelligence.**

### Deliverables
- unified structural data model  
- cross‑layer consistency constraints  
- structural loop orchestration  
- world‑aware reasoning  
- identity‑aware behavior  
- knowledge‑driven world generation  

### Outcome
WLM becomes a **coherent structural intelligence system**, not seven separate modules.

---

# 🟥 Phase 4 — Structural Universe Engine  
**Goal:** WLM becomes capable of generating entire coherent universes.**

### Deliverables
- multi‑world topology  
- cross‑world causal systems  
- narrative universes  
- simulation‑ready world graphs  
- agent populations  
- emergent structural dynamics  

### Outcome
WLM becomes a **universe‑scale generative protocol**.

---

# 🟪 Phase 5 — Tooling, Ecosystem, and Runtime  
**Goal:** Make WLM usable by developers, researchers, and creators.**

### Deliverables
- WLM runtime  
- WLM CLI  
- WLM SDK  
- visualization tools  
- structural graph inspector  
- world simulation sandbox  

### Outcome
WLM becomes a **developer ecosystem**, not just a protocol.

---

# 🟫 Phase 6 — Structural Intelligence Applications  
**Goal:** Apply WLM to real domains.**

### Potential Applications
- autonomous agents  
- virtual worlds  
- simulation engines  
- narrative systems  
- knowledge reasoning  
- scientific modeling  
- structural search engines  
- AI‑native operating systems  

### Outcome
WLM becomes a **general‑purpose structural intelligence platform**.

---

# 🟨 Long‑Term Vision  
**WLM is the protocol stack for structured intelligence.**

The end state is:

> **An AI that understands, reasons, acts, knows, monitors itself, and generates worlds — all through structure.**

WLM becomes:

- a universal semantic substrate  
- a world engine  
- a reasoning engine  
- a knowledge engine  
- a simulation engine  
- a structural intelligence architecture  

---

# 📌 Summary

WLM evolves through:

1. **MVP** — structural skeleton  
2. **Functional Engines** — each layer becomes real  
3. **Integration** — the structural loop becomes unified  
4. **Universe Engine** — world‑scale generation  
5. **Runtime + Tools** — developer ecosystem  
6. **Applications** — structural intelligence everywhere  

WLM is a **20‑year architecture**, not a single project.
