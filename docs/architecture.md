# WLM Architecture  
**The Seven‑Layer Structural Protocol Stack**

WLM (Wujie Language Model) is a **multi‑layer structural architecture** that transforms AI from a token‑predictor into a **structured, interpretable, controllable, world‑generating intelligence**.

This document describes the **full architecture** of WLM:  
its layers, flows, dependencies, and the structural principles that unify the entire system.

# 🧱 1. Architectural Philosophy

WLM is built on a single foundational idea:

> **Intelligence is structure.**

Not tokens.  
Not embeddings.  
Not opaque world models.  
Not stochastic sampling.

Structure is:

- interpretable  
- causal  
- dimensional  
- composable  
- stable  
- simulation‑ready  

WLM is the first AI architecture that treats **structure as the primary substrate** of intelligence.

# 🏛️ 2. The Seven Layers (High‑Level)

WLM is composed of **seven protocol layers**, each responsible for a different dimension of structural intelligence:

1. **SLP — Structural Language Protocol**  
2. **LWM Interpreter — World Model → Structure**  
3. **Agent Behavior Structure Layer**  
4. **Persona / Character Structure Layer**  
5. **Knowledge Structuring Layer**  
6. **Metacognition Layer**  
7. **World Generation Protocol (WGP)**  

Each layer is:

- independent  
- composable  
- deterministic  
- interpretable  
- extensible  

Together, they form a **closed structural loop**.

---

# 🔄 3. The WLM Structural Loop

This is the core of the architecture — the loop that turns WLM into a **self‑consistent universe generator**.

```
Input
  → Structural Language (SLP)
  → World Structure (LWM)
  → Behavior Structure (Agent)
  → Persona Structure (Identity)
  → Knowledge Structure (Graph)
  → Reasoning Structure (Metacognition)
  → World Generation (WGP)
```

This loop ensures:

- consistency  
- stability  
- interpretability  
- extensibility  
- world‑level coherence  

It is the **engine of structural intelligence**.

---

# 🧩 4. Layer‑by‑Layer Architecture

Below is the detailed architecture of each layer and how they connect.

---

## **4.1 Structural Language Protocol (SLP)**  
**Input → Dimensional Structure**

SLP converts raw input into structured semantic dimensions:

- entities  
- relations  
- spatial frames  
- temporal frames  
- causal frames  
- identity frames  

SLP is the **protocol layer** that all other layers depend on.

**Output:** A structured semantic graph.

---

## **4.2 World Model Interpreter (LWM → Structure)**  
**World Model Output → Interpretable Structure**

Takes outputs from world models (video, physics, spatial predictions) and converts them into:

- spatial topology  
- physical constraints  
- object permanence  
- causal dynamics  

This layer makes world models **explainable**.

**Output:** A structured world state.

---

## **4.3 Agent Behavior Structure Layer**  
**Structure → Stable Behavior**

Generates behavior from structure:

- goals  
- constraints  
- affordances  
- action graphs  
- decision flows  

This layer ensures agents are:

- stable  
- reproducible  
- controllable  
- non‑chaotic  

**Output:** A structured behavior graph.

---

## **4.4 Persona / Character Structure Layer**  
**Structure → Identity**

Defines stable, consistent identities:

- traits  
- values  
- memory  
- narrative arcs  
- role constraints  

This layer ensures personas do not drift or collapse.

**Output:** A structured identity graph.

---

## **4.5 Knowledge Structuring Layer**  
**Token Soup → Structured Knowledge**

Converts unstructured text into:

- knowledge graphs  
- causal graphs  
- definitional structures  
- hierarchical ontologies  

This layer enables **real reasoning**, not memorization.

**Output:** A structured knowledge graph.

---

## **4.6 Metacognition Layer**  
**Structure → Reasoning Path → Self‑Monitoring**

Tracks:

- reasoning steps  
- consistency  
- dimension shifts  
- self‑checks  
- contradictions  

This layer makes reasoning **transparent and controllable**.

**Output:** A structured reasoning trace.

---

## **4.7 World Generation Protocol (WGP)**  
**Structure → Worlds**

Generates:

- spatial topology  
- timelines  
- physical rules  
- causal systems  
- narrative arcs  
- simulation‑ready world graphs  

This is the **world engine** of WLM.

**Output:** A structured world graph.

---

# 🧬 5. Cross‑Layer Data Model

All layers communicate using a **unified structural format**:

```
Node
  - type
  - dimensions
  - attributes
  - constraints

Edge
  - relation
  - direction
  - causal weight
```

This ensures:

- interoperability  
- composability  
- deterministic behavior  
- world‑level coherence  

---

# 🏗️ 6. Architectural Guarantees

WLM guarantees:

- **Determinism**  
  Same structure → same behavior → same world.

- **Interpretability**  
  Every layer produces explicit structure.

- **Composability**  
  Layers can be combined, extended, or replaced.

- **Stability**  
  No drift, collapse, or stochastic chaos.

- **World‑Level Coherence**  
  All layers share the same structural substrate.

---

# 🚀 7. Why This Architecture Works

Because it replaces:

- token prediction → **structure generation**  
- embedding soup → **dimensional semantics**  
- prompt hacks → **identity structure**  
- hallucination → **metacognitive monitoring**  
- random worlds → **structural world generation**  

WLM is the first architecture designed for **structured intelligence**.

---

# 📌 Summary

WLM is a **seven‑layer structural protocol stack** that unifies:

- language  
- world models  
- behavior  
- identity  
- knowledge  
- reasoning  
- world generation  

into a single coherent architecture.

It is the **blueprint for a structured AI universe**.
