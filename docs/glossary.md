# WLM Glossary  
**Core Terms of the Structural Universe Protocol**

This glossary defines the foundational concepts used throughout WLM.  
Every term is precise, dimensional, and part of the structural vocabulary of the Wujie Language Model.

# 🧱 A — C

### **Action Graph**  
A structured representation of agent behavior, including goals, constraints, and decision flows.

### **Agent Structure**  
The dimensional representation of an agent’s behavior, affordances, and constraints.

### **Causal Graph**  
A structure encoding cause–effect relationships between events, entities, or rules.

### **Causal System**  
A world‑level structure defining how changes propagate through time and space.

### **Character Structure**  
The identity graph of a persona, including traits, values, memory, and role constraints.

### **Constraint Propagation**  
The process of applying structural rules across layers to maintain consistency.

---

# 🧬 D — F

### **Dimensional Structure**  
The core data format of WLM: entities, relations, frames, constraints, and causal links.

### **Entity**  
A structured object in a world: agent, item, location, concept, or system.

### **Frame (Spatial / Temporal / Causal)**  
A structural container defining context for interpretation or reasoning.

### **Functional Layer**  
A WLM layer that transforms structure into another form of structure (e.g., identity → behavior).

---

# 🧠 G — L

### **Graph (Semantic / World / Knowledge / Identity)**  
The universal representation format across all WLM layers.

### **Identity Graph**  
The structured representation of a persona’s stable traits and constraints.

### **Knowledge Graph**  
A structured representation of concepts, definitions, relations, and causal knowledge.

### **Layer (WLM Layer)**  
One of the seven structural engines that transform structure into higher‑order structure.

### **LWM (World Model Interpreter)**  
The layer that converts world‑model predictions into interpretable structure.

---

# 🌐 M — P

### **Metacognition**  
The structural monitoring of reasoning steps, consistency, and dimension shifts.

### **Narrative Arc**  
A structured timeline of events, transitions, and causal developments in a world.

### **Node**  
A structural unit in any WLM graph (entity, concept, identity, region, event).

### **Persona Structure**  
The stable identity constraints that govern how an agent behaves and speaks.

### **Physical Rule**  
A structural constraint defining how the world behaves (gravity, motion, energy, etc.).

---

# 🔄 R — S

### **Reasoning Trace**  
A structured record of the AI’s reasoning steps, checks, and transformations.

### **Region**  
A spatial node in a world’s topology.

### **Rule System**  
A set of physical, causal, or narrative rules that govern a world.

### **SLP (Structural Language Protocol)**  
The layer that converts raw input into dimensional structure.

### **Structural Intelligence**  
An AI paradigm where structure — not tokens — is the substrate of understanding, reasoning, and world generation.

### **Structural Loop**  
The closed cycle connecting all seven WLM layers.

---

# 🌌 T — W

### **Timeline**  
A structured sequence of events with causal and temporal relationships.

### **Topology (Spatial / Narrative / Causal)**  
The structural arrangement of nodes and edges in a world.

### **Universe Graph**  
A multi‑world structure generated by WGP in advanced phases.

### **WGP (World Generation Protocol)**  
The layer that generates worlds, rules, timelines, and simulation‑ready structures.

### **World Graph**  
The complete structural representation of a generated world.
