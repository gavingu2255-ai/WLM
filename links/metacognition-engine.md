# Metacognition Layer  
**Layer 6 of the WLM Structural Universe**

The Metacognition Engine provides **self‑monitoring, reasoning transparency, and structural consistency**.

# 🧠 Purpose  
Modern AI reasoning is:

- opaque  
- untraceable  
- inconsistent  
- hallucination‑prone  

The Metacognition Layer fixes this by generating:

- reasoning traces  
- consistency checks  
- dimension‑shift logs  
- contradiction detection  
- self‑monitoring loops  

This makes reasoning **transparent and controllable**.

# 🧬 Structure → Reasoning Trace

```
Knowledge / Identity / World Structure
                     ↓
        Structured Reasoning Path
```

Reasoning becomes:

- inspectable  
- debuggable  
- deterministic  
- structurally grounded

# 🧩 Role in the Structural Loop

```
SLP → LWM → Agent → Persona → Knowledge → Metacognition → World Generation
```

The Metacognition layer is the **self‑awareness substrate** of WLM —  
it ensures the entire system stays coherent.
