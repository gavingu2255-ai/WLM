# Agent Behavior Structure Layer  
**Layer 3 of the WLM Structural Universe**

The Agent Behavior Structure Layer transforms dimensional structure into **stable, controllable, reproducible behavior**.

# 🤖 Purpose  
This layer defines how an agent **acts** inside a structured world.

It generates:

- action graphs  
- goal structures  
- constraint‑driven decisions  
- affordance maps  
- multi‑agent coordination flows  

Agents stop behaving like stochastic samplers and start behaving like **structured entities**.

# 🧬 Structure → Behavior

```
World / Identity / Knowledge Structure
                     ↓
         Structured Behavior Graph
```

Behavior becomes:

- deterministic  
- interpretable  
- controllable  
- consistent across time

# 🧩 Role in the Structural Loop

```
SLP → LWM → Agent → Persona → Knowledge → Metacognition → World Generation
```

The Agent layer is the **execution engine** of WLM —  
it turns structure into **action**.
