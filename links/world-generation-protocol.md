# World Generation Protocol (WGP)  
**Layer 7 of the WLM Structural Universe**

The World Generation Protocol transforms dimensional structure into **coherent, simulation‑ready worlds**.

# 🌌 Purpose  
WGP is the **world engine** of WLM.

It generates:

- spatial topology  
- regions and subregions  
- entities and populations  
- physical rule systems  
- causal systems  
- timelines and event chains  
- narrative arcs  
- simulation‑ready world graphs  

This is the layer where structure becomes **worlds**.

# 🧬 Structure → World

```
Identity / Knowledge / Behavior / Causality
                        ↓
            Structured World Graph
```

A world is not random.  
A world is **structure**.

WGP ensures:

- spatial coherence  
- causal coherence  
- narrative coherence  
- identity coherence  
- rule coherence  

Everything aligns.

# 🧩 Role in the Structural Loop

```
SLP → LWM → Agent → Persona → Knowledge → Metacognition → World Generation
```

WGP is the **final stage** of the structural loop —  
the point where all structure converges into a **generated universe**.

# 🚀 Why It Matters  
WGP enables:

- virtual worlds  
- simulation engines  
- narrative universes  
- multi‑agent environments  
- structural game worlds  
- scientific world modeling  
- AI‑native world generation  

This is the layer that turns WLM from a reasoning engine into a **universe engine**.
