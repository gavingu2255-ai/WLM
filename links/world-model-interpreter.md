# World Model Interpreter  
**Layer 2 of the WLM Structural Universe**

The World Model Interpreter converts world‑model predictions into **interpretable dimensional structure**.

# 🌍 Purpose  
Modern world models predict pixels and latent states — but they do not explain them.  
This layer makes world models **structurally interpretable**.

It extracts:

- spatial topology  
- object permanence  
- physical constraints  
- causal dynamics  
- event structure

# 🧬 World Model → Structure

```
World Model Output (video/physics/spatial)
                ↓
Structured World State (topology, objects, causality)
```

This turns opaque predictions into **explicit world structure**.

# 🧩 Role in the Structural Loop

```
SLP → LWM → Agent → Persona → Knowledge → Metacognition → World Generation
```

The LWM Interpreter is the **bridge** between raw world‑model predictions and the structured universe of WLM.
