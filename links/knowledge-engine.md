# Knowledge Structuring Layer  
**Layer 5 of the WLM Structural Universe**

The Knowledge Engine transforms unstructured text into **structured, reason‑ready knowledge**.

# 📚 Purpose  
Modern AI stores knowledge as:

- token sequences  
- embeddings  
- latent vectors  

These formats cannot reason, explain, or maintain consistency.

The Knowledge Engine converts raw information into:

- knowledge graphs  
- definitional networks  
- causal graphs  
- hierarchical ontologies  
- structured concept maps  

This is **real understanding**, not memorization.

# 🧬 Text → Structured Knowledge

```
Unstructured Text / Data
            ↓
   Structured Knowledge Graph
```

Knowledge becomes:

- interpretable  
- causal  
- composable  
- queryable  
- stable across time

# 🧩 Role in the Structural Loop

```
SLP → LWM → Agent → Persona → Knowledge → Metacognition → World Generation
```

The Knowledge layer is the **memory substrate** of WLM —  
it defines what the system *knows* and how it *reasons*.
