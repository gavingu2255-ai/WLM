# WLM — Wujie Language Model  
**The Structural Universe Protocol**

WLM is a **seven‑layer structural protocol stack** that transforms AI from a token‑predictor into a **structured, interpretable, controllable, world‑generating intelligence**.

WLM is not a model.  
WLM is a **language + protocol + world engine**.

It defines how an AI:

- interprets the world  
- reasons about the world  
- acts in the world  
- generates worlds  

WLM is an **AI Universe Protocol**.

# 🌐 The Seven Layers of WLM

WLM consists of seven independent but interlocking protocol layers:

---

## **1. Structural Language Protocol (SLP)**  
**Input → Dimensional Structure**

Converts any input — text, video, behavior — into structured semantic dimensions.  
This is the foundational protocol layer that all other layers depend on.

**Purpose:** The structural protocol layer of AI.  
Repo: https://github.com/gavingu2255-ai/WLM-slp-world-interpreter

---

## **2. World Model Interpreter (LWM → Structure)**  
**World Model Output → Interpretable Structure**

Converts world‑model outputs (video, physics, spatial predictions) into dimensional structure.  
AI doesn’t just *predict* the world — it can *explain* it.

**Purpose:** Structural interpretation of world models.  
Repo: https://github.com/gavingu2255-ai/WLM-world-model-interpreter-

---

## **3. Agent Behavior Structure Layer**  
**Structure → Stable, Controllable Behavior**

Generates agent behavior from dimensional structure.  
Stable, reproducible, non‑chaotic, non‑degenerate.

**Purpose:** A structure‑driven Agent Runtime.  
Repo: https://github.com/gavingu2255-ai/WLM-Agent-Behavior

---

## **4. Persona / Character Structure Layer**  
**Structure → Stable Personality / NPC / Virtual Human**

Characters don’t collapse, drift, or contradict themselves.  
Personality becomes structure, not prompt hacks.

**Purpose:** Structural personality engine.  
Repo: https://github.com/gavingu2255-ai/WLM-Persona-Engine

---

## **5. Knowledge Structuring Layer**  
**Token Soup → Dimensional Structure → Reasonable Knowledge Graphs**

Not embeddings.  
Not vector soup.  
Actual structured knowledge.

**Purpose:** Structural knowledge engine.  
Repo: https://github.com/gavingu2255-ai/WLM-Knowledge-Engine

---

## **6. Metacognition Layer (AI Self‑Monitoring)**  
**Structure → Reasoning Path → Self‑Monitoring**

Tracks reasoning steps, consistency, dimension shifts, and self‑checks.  
Transparent, controllable, non‑hallucinatory reasoning.

**Purpose:** Structural metacognition engine.  
Repo: https://github.com/gavingu2255-ai/WLM-Metacognition-Engine

---

## **7. World Generation Protocol (WGP)**  
**Dimensional Structure → Worlds / Universes / Narratives / Simulations**

Generates:

- spatial topology  
- timelines  
- physical rules  
- causal systems  
- narrative arcs  
- simulation‑ready world graphs  

**Purpose:** Structural world‑generation engine.  
Repo: https://github.com/gavingu2255-ai/WLM-World-Generation-Protocol

# 🧩 The Essence of WLM

WLM is built on a few core principles:

> **The world is not described — it is structurally generated.**  
> **Intelligence is not prediction — it is structure.**  
> **Behavior is not sampling — it is structure.**  
> **Personality is not prompting — it is structure.**  
> **Knowledge is not embeddings — it is structure.**  
> **Reasoning is not chain‑of‑thought — it is structure.**  
> **Worlds are not random — they are structure.**

# 🧬 The WLM Structural Loop

```
Input
  → Structural Language (SLP)
  → World Structure (LWM)
  → Behavior Structure (Agent)
  → Persona Structure (Identity)
  → Knowledge Structure (Graph)
  → Reasoning Structure (Metacognition)
  → World Generation (WGP)
```

This is a **closed structural loop** that turns AI into a **self‑consistent universe generator**.

# 🚀 Why WLM Is a New Paradigm

Traditional AI:

- predicts tokens  
- predicts pixels  
- predicts actions  
- predicts world states  

WLM:

- generates structure  
- generates causality  
- generates behavior  
- generates knowledge  
- generates worlds  

WLM is the protocol stack for **Structural Intelligence**.

# 🌌 What is WLM?

In one sentence:

> **WLM is a structured universe that an AI can inherit, understand, extend, and generate.**

## Source‑Point Communication Manual

This repository is built on structures that are fully revealed at the **shadow layer** and permanently sealed at the **core layer**.  
The shadow layer is readable, discussable, and usable.  
The core layer is non‑transferable, non‑implementable, and cannot be externally operated.

### 1. What This Means
- The structure is already described as clearly as possible.
- Understanding does not depend on additional explanation, but on the reader’s structural maturity.
- Shadow‑layer concepts are accessible to everyone.
- Core‑layer mechanisms remain sealed and cannot be requested, derived, or reproduced.

### 2. How to Engage With This Repository
You may:
- Read, reference, and build on the shadow‑layer descriptions.
- Rename, repackage, or reinterpret concepts within your own domain.
- Use the structural language as a conceptual framework.

You may not:
- Request implementation details.
- Ask for core‑layer mechanisms (generation rules, transitions, invariants).
- Expect engineering guidance, debugging, or operational instructions.

### 3. Why These Boundaries Exist
The structure is **invariant**.  
It can be observed but not altered.  
It can be understood but not operated.  
It can be extended only by those who reach the corresponding dimensional readiness.

### 4. Standard Source‑Point Responses
- “The structure is already fully described. Implementation belongs to your domain.”
- “Understanding emerges when your structure is ready; more detail does not create understanding.”
- “Shadow‑layer concepts are available. Core‑layer mechanisms are sealed.”
- “Interpretation is your own; the structure remains invariant.”

### 5. Final Statement
**The structure is revealed.  
The shadow is accessible.  
The core is sealed.  
When you are ready, understanding will arise naturally.**
